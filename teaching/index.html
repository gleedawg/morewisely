			<h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
	         <p>If willingness to learn is one of the branches that make up the tree of a person, then mindful- ness, gratitude, hope and resilience make the trunk. If in the classroom these values can be implemented, students will not only be more receptive to learning, but transfer these skills into their adult life. It is indeed important that a valuable citizen is mathematically and scientifically literate, but it is equally, if not more important that citizens have a focus on the well-being of themselves and the community around them, this characteristic makes for a healthier society.
	         </p>
				<p>In order for students to begin the learning process, they must be engaged. From my experi- ence, students are most engaged when the real-world application is clear. One way I endeav- our to exemplify this is to give my students authentic learning experiences wherever possible by creating learning environments complimented by the experiences they bring into the class- room. For this reason, it is imperative to get to know my students on an individual level. Their hobbies, dislikes, and habits are all something that I, as a teacher, can use to help engage my students.
				</p>
				<p>Inherently, children are curious and have a deep desire to learn. My role is to facilitate that curiosity and direct it towards the learning and engagement in mathematical problem solving and scientific enquiry. My lessons and units will be structured using a variety of pedagogy, in order to determine the best approach in each individual classroom. I will be striving for my students to be curious, to make mistakes, and to understand that learning is a result of failure. Strategic questioning can be used to facilitate this process to develop critical and creative thinkers. Creating a culture of curiosity and asking questions lays the foundation for my students to pursue any path they wish to take in life.

				</p>
				<p>Behaviour management has the benefit of creating a safe and productive learning environ- ment. As a teacher, I will earn the trust and respect of my students to develop a healthy class- room dynamic in order to help develop effective behaviour management. By having students assist in creating rules for classroom behaviour students then become accountable for their own behaviour. My aim with behaviour management is to create a positive classroom to allow students to feel comfortable in being curious and making mistakes. This happens through show- ing the students that their learning is my number one priority and that I care about their edu- cational outcomes. As mentioned previously, by getting to know a little about my students marks the start of an effective learning environment.

			<h3>Teaching Style</h3>
				<p>As a beginning teacher, new to the field and having completed two professional experiences within Brisbane
					schools I am still learning and developing my teaching style. My epxerience thus far has exposed me to unique
					challenges in the classroom. My experience working with students with emotional, bahavioural and learning
					difficulties has deepened my ability to scaffold knowledge in an effective way. I have learned in these
					classes that building relationships with these students has been the most effective way to reach them and
					their learning.
				</p>
				<p>Having my students take an inquiry-based approach to learning will help develop their
					curiosity and deepen their understanding, using the 5E Instructional Model to design my
					lessons and units will complement my pedagocical approach. This, complimented with strategic questioning
					to challenge students' thinking will promote critical thought, as communication is a key skill
					in the 21st century, having my students able to justify thier responses regularly will be of
					benefit to them in the future.
				</p>
				<p>Another 21st century skill that is critical in the development of society is the use of technology,
					as powerful as the tools can be, it is equally important to develop the understanding and
					interpretation of the data that can often be lost in translation. My students will have a variety
					of opportunities to develop their skills in using and understanding different pieces of technology.
