			<h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
         <p>
				I've been fortunate enough to be surrounded by people who value personal growth
				and continuous understanding of the world around us. Even more fortunate is that
				I have developed the same habits. Educating ourselves and others is how we deepen
				our experience of this world.
         </p>
			<p>If willingness to learn are one of the branches that make up the tree of a person,
				then mindfulness, gratitude, hope and resilience make the trunk. If in the classroom
				exercises take place that promote these underlying values in students not only will
				they be more receptive to learning but take these skills throughout their adult life.
				What makes a valuable citizen in our society is mathematical and scientific literacy,
				yes, but also a population that has well-being as a focus also.
			</p>
			<p>Inherently, children are curious and have a deep desire to learn, my role is to engage
				that curiosity and direct it towards the learning of mathematical problem solving and
				scientific enquiry. Although I will predominantly be in control of the content they are
				to learn relevant to the Australian Curriculum, they are to direct their own learning of
				said content. The 5E Instructional Modal is a useful tool for my explicit instruction,
				the structure of my unit plans and lesson plans and most importantly this pedagogy
				creates a medium in which mathematical and scientific enquiry is the norm. Creating a
				culture of curiosity and asking questions lays the foundation for my students in any
				path they wish to take in life.
			</p>
			<p>In order for students to begin the learning process, they must be engaged in, students
				will engage when they see a need or reason for their use. I endeavour to give my
				students an authentic learning experience wherever possible in order to maximise
				their academic potential.
			</p>
			<p>A challenge in the classroom is to acknowledge the differences in students' abilities.
				The 5E Instructional Model addresses this well using strategic questioning and cooperative
				learning to facilitate the students' knowledge acquisition. Part of this learning
				process involves Vygotski's Zone of Proximal Development and students teaching each
				other with myself acting as the facilitator of their questioning and discussion.
