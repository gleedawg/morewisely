			<h3>My Coffee</h3>
         <p>I regularly make a cold brew coffee called 86 400 Coffee. It's an experimental project in which use different beans, milk and sometime sugar to create a delicious iced-coffee, all the feedback I've had has been positive.

			<h3>My Website & Blog</h3>
			<p>
            I created this website as a means of professional and creative self-expression.
            <br><br>
            It gave me the opportunity to learn HTML and CSS to the point where I could create a simple website as a favour for a friend.
            <br><br>
            My
            <a href="blog/index.html">blog</a>
            was originally created to express my thoughts and at the same time, have a public forum for which others could critique my writing.

			<h3>My Fitness</h3>
         <p>
            CrossFit was the first venture in my fitness journey and I did that for 2 years.
            <br><br>
            Next was weightlifting at my local PCYC gym.
            <br><br>
            Now I'm just getting started in climbing. Mostly bouldering at this stage at the local climbing gym. My climbing was going really well, I was torn between it and running - running won. I started doing just a weekly run at the local Parkrun here in Southbank, I got my time down to a fairly good pace of around 4 min/km. The next obvious step was to complete a marathon. So I did.
				<br><br>
				I just completed the Gold Coast Marathon on the 1st of July 2018, the greatest challenge of my life. I think I might settle down into becoming competitive in the 5-10km range. More sustainable on the body in the long run.

				<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>
				Prodigal university student returning to study my passion. I worked as a civil engineer
				for 15 months at various mine sites in the Bowen Basin. In that time, I developed highly
				transferrable skills in Business Development and project delivery. I developed a quick
				rapport with people I met, and possess a strong work ethic. To make a lasting difference
				in the world has always been a goal I've strived for. I'm going back to university to
				follow my interests of inspiring students to be their genuine self, studying to become
				a maths/science secondary teacher.

				<h3>Employment</h3>
				<p><strong>Learning Coach and one-to-one tutor</strong>
					<br>
					<i>Fruition Tuition</i>
					<p class="emp-descript">
						I walk into the tutoring centre wanting to improve my student's lives and thier
						studies. Working closely with the franchisee and centre leader I developed a science
						unit plan focused on enagaging students' interest in Science.
						<br><br>
						To the credit of the
						aforementioned in pairing me with the right students I have developed lasting, meaningful
						relationships with my students. This has allowed me to tap into my students strengths and
						enable their skills where needed in their studies.
					</p>
				</p>
				<p><strong>Graduate Civil Engineer</strong>
					<br>
					<i>TMM Group</i>
					<p class="emp-descript">
						Working for TMM was my first engineering job out of university. I'll be forever grateful
						for the wonderful opportunities that it's people gave me. Never had I been exposed to so
						many sides of a business. I was involved in the procurement of multi-million dollar projects,
						and given the opportunity to work on-site at some of these projects. This gave me integral
						knowledge of project costing and productivity and its impact on the overall business.
						<br><br>
						I'll always remember TMM as giving me the indespensible opportunity which didn't have to
						come my way.
					</p>
				</p>
				<p><strong>Undergraduate Civil/Structural Engineer</strong>
					<br>
					<i>LogiCamms</i>
					<p class="emp-descript">
						In my third year of university I got given the opportunity to work under a principle
						structural engineer at LogiCamms, still friends with this man to date he taught me a
						repertoire of skills involving structural analysis of upgrades to buildings, developing a
						spreadsheet to determine particular geotechnical proporties of soil and undertaking
						feasibility studies on the use of solar power on a large scale and LogiCamms entrance into
						the water market.
						<br><br>
						Working briefly at LogiCamms gave me my first insight into the prospect of using my civil
						engineering degree as a path to a sustainable career.
