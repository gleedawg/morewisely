			<h2>Being an Educator.</h2>
				<p>I prefer to talk from a point of view of the thoughts and feelings I have about the world.</p>
				<p>I worked as an engineer from 2015 - 2017. I didn't find my job personally satisfying. I prefer to work closely with people.</p>
				<p>Looking back at that decision to move from engineering to teaching, it didn't seem like the right choice at first. I was nervous and unsure.</p>
				<p>It's daunting taking a turn in your career, but I held out and said to myself, "I'll know for sure if I'm right for the classroom after the first week of being a student teacher". The risk to changing jobs paid off. Three years later, I'm still here</p>
				<p>With each year I learn more, about myself and about the teacher I one day hope to be.</p>
			<h2>Being Human.<h2>
				<p>I try my best everyday. Sometimes I do well. Sometimes I do not.</p>
				<p>The next day I wawke up and try again to be better.</p>
				<p>Actually, why I'm on this thought tangent. I struggle with the concept of "better". What is better? What makes it better? According to what moral framework is something better? (or even good for that matter)</p>
				<p>From a personal point of view, being "better" makes me think of other words like contribution, fulfilment, enjoyment. That way, it's easier for me to conceptualise these ideas.</p>
				<p>Anyway so I try everyday I try to be better.</p>
