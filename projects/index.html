			<h3>My Photography</h3>
         <p>
            I like to get behind a camera sometimes.
            <br>
            Here are some shots.

			<h3>My Coffee</h3>
         <p>
            I regularly make a cold brew coffee called 86 400 Coffee. It's an experimental project in which use
				different beans, milk and sometime sugar to create a delicious iced-coffee, all the feedback I've
				had has been positive.
            <br>
            So if you're in the Brisbane area and interested, get in touch.

			<h3>My Website & Blog</h3>
			<p>
            I created this website as a means of professional and creative self-expression.
            <br><br>
            It gave me the opportunity to learn HTML and CSS to the point where I could create
            a simple website as a favour for a friend.
            <br><br>
            My
            <a href="morewisely.com/blog">blog</a>
            was originally created to express my thoughts and at the same time, have a public forum
            for which others could critique my writing.

			<h3>My Fitness</h3>
         <p>
            CrossFit was the first venture in my fitness journey and I did that for 2 years.
            <br><br>
            Next was weightlifting at my local PCYC gym.
            <br><br>
            Now I'm just getting started in climbing. Mostly bouldering at this stage at the
            local climbing gym.
